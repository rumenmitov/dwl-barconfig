#+title: Barconfig
#+author: Rumen Mitov

This patch *requires* the dwl [[https://codeberg.org/dwl/dwl-patches/src/branch/main/patches/bar][barconfig]] patch be applied first! The barconfig patch provides configuration for the dwl bar via the variable
=barlayout=. This determines which of the elements listed below to
display on the bar and in which order:

- 't' -> the tags
- 'l' -> the current layout symbol
- 'n' -> the window name
- 's' -> the status message
- '|' -> elements on the right of this separator will be displayed from
         the right

*NOTE*: This patch is a dwl port of the [[https://dwm.suckless.org/patches/barconfig/][original]] barconfig patch for dwm.

*** Known Issues With Patch
Changing the location of the tags breaks the tag button presses (the buttons expect the click in the usual location of the tags). I do not have any plans to look into this, as I ported this patch for the sole purpose of having the option to omit the layout symbol from 
the bar.
